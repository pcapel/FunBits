# Periodic Name!
This is something that I started thinking about way back when I was a substitute
teacher.  My first gig was subbing for a chemistry class, and this was one of
the assignments that the teacher left me.

Using the symbols of the periodic table, try to spell your name!

At the time, I was learning javascript.  I wrote a version of this on CodePen
that was really quite awful.  I'll probably write up another JS version as well.
But I'd been meaning for a while to get a python version since my experience has
grown!
